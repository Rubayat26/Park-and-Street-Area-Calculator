# Park-and-Street-Area-Calculator
A Park and Street Area comparator based on park size and street size




Suppose that you're working in a small town administration, and you're in charge of two town elements:
 Parks
 Streets

It's a very small town, so right now there are only 3 parks and 4 streets. All parks and streets have a name and a build year.

At an end-of-year meeting, your boss wants a final report with the following:
Tree density of each park in the town (formula: number of trees/park area)
Average age of each town's park (formula: sum of all ages/number of parks)
The name of the park that has more than 1000 trees
Total and average length of the town's streets
Size classification of all streets: tiny/small/normal/big/huge. If the size is unknown, the default is normal
HINT: You can use function constructors to create trees and parks. 
A park function constructor would look like this: function Park(name, total_trees, age)
A street function constructor would look like this: function Street(name, size)
You can put the ‘parks’ and ‘streets’ in separate arrays and iterate that area to calculate valuable information
